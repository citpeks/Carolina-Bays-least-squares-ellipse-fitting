# Carolina-Bays-least-squares-ellipse-fitting
The Carolina Bays are shallow elliptical depressions along the Atlantic Seaboard. The Python programs included here process sample points along the perimeter of the bays and fit them with an ellipse using the least squares method.

August 8, 2024 changes:
driver2d.py now requests an input file name. If no file name is provided, the default file (driver2d-coords.txt) is used. Additional checks were added to check the validity of the input.

September 2, 2024 further work:
The program was ported to PyScript to be able to run the program in a web browser without the need to install Python on a computer.
